Dataconsistancy Problems with Caching due to multi node environment
To address the problem

1) Data invalidation
2) Data Replication

Dont operate applicaion with bigger heap size just for the purpose if Caching. Its lead to long major GCs
Too small cahe also a bad idea as we need to flush the old data more frequently and replicate to other nodes
Also we will have less hits due to lack of data and leads to pooe peformance gains

Distributed Caching
